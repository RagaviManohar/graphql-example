What is GRAPHQL ?
    GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
    GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API.
    Gives you the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more.

Get many resources in a single request
    REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request.
    Apps using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network connections.
